# Guide about our Model in Your Machine

Here are the guide regarding our model. 

Requirements
Libraries: TensorFlow, JSON, NLTK, SKLearn, and NumPy (for testing)
Internet (to import data online)

We recommend you to use Google Colab as it already have the required libraries.
1. Open the Source.ipynb for interactive python notebook or Source.py for python script
2. As the data is available online, you don't need to download the dataset manually.
3. Run the script (it will generate labels.json and the model in form of .tflite)
